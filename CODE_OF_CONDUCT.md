# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Team participation 

* I will not be late for team meetings. 
* I will ask for help when I need it. 
* I will provide help when asked. 
* I will be honest at all times. 
* If I don't believe something is possible I will say so without hesitation. 

## Peer reviews

* I will be professional and tactful when providing review comments. 
* I will be open to receiving feedback when others review my work. 

## Writing code: 

* I will add comments to code where needed to help in team member's understanding. 
* I will write code that adheres to my team's formatting and style conventions. 
* I will not submit production code without thorough in-memory unit tests. 
* I will not submit code that causes any tool to emit a warning. 

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
